# Orbit Sling Site – Agent Guidance

## Purpose
Build a clear, trustworthy replacement website for Orbit Sling (orbitsling.com). Most visitors are checking that we are real. The site should quickly answer: who we are, what we do, and how to contact us.

## Hosting
GitHub Pages. Keep it simple and static. Prefer plain HTML/CSS/JS with minimal or no build tooling.

## Tone & Content Priorities
- Plain, confident, factual.
- Lead with a one‑sentence explanation of what Orbit Sling does.
- Add proof of legitimacy: address, team, partners, or visible case studies if available.
- Make contact paths obvious (email, form, phone).

## Structure (Suggested)
- Hero: one‑line value proposition + short subtext + primary CTA.
- “What we do” section in 3–5 bullets.
- Trust section: logo strip, testimonials, or stats.
- “About / Team” with real names and photos.
- Contact footer with legal/business details.

## Assets
Brand assets are in `/brandassets`.

## Brand
Use the Orbit Sling palette and typography. See `BRAND_GUIDELINES.md`.

## Accessibility
- Maintain strong contrast and readable type sizes.
- Avoid tiny text on bright colors.
- Ensure links and buttons are clearly distinguishable.
